# React Native Expo Template

## Installation steps

1.  Install Node.js LTS. This allows us to set up and write serverside Javascript. This comes included with Chocolatey and NPM, for installing dependancies and packages. https://nodejs.org
2.  Install Git. https://git-scm.com/
3.  On the command line, run the command `npm install --global expo-cli` to install the Expo client on your computer.
4.  Clone this repo, and run `npm i`to install all the packages.
5.  To edit the app, open App.tsx and edit.
6.  To run the app, whilst in the directory, use `npm run ios` or `npm run android` to start the Expo environment. This will open a new web page, where you can scan the QR code using the Expo app to test on a physical device, or open an emulator and Expo should automatically install and open the Expo client app on it.
